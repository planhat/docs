# Base URL
Depending on where you're located, the base URL to access the Planhat API may differ.

`https://api.planhat.com`

OR

`https://api-eu.planhat.com`

So if you see a resource end-point like this one:

POST: /analytics/[YOUR_TENANT_ID]

It implies the full URL will be either

`https://api.planhat.com/analytics/[YOUR_TENANT_ID]`

or

`https://api-eu.planhat.com/analytics/[YOUR_TENANT_ID]`
